# Assignment 3 - Hangman ü¶ñ

##I will represent my comments using a double hashtag (##)! 

## I think it would be helpful for people not familiar with this code or the assignment that you put a subtitle for lines 8 to 37 (ie. Assignment Details)
##so they don't get this section confused with your gameplan for this assignment
# Prepare a dictionary of words to choose from and save it in a txt file (one column) and save it in the project directory
# Read the word list from your program.

# Choose a random element from the list. Hint: You may want to check sample() and sample.int()  functions. There are many different ways of doing this. You are welcome to experiment.

# Inform the user on the length of the secret word. Hint: You may test nchar()

# Inform the user about the number of wrong guesses/tries allowed. You decide on the rule here and implement it. Please comment your code appropriately.

# Ask for user input. The user is expected to enter one character only, check for this.


# Optional; check if the character is a letter
# Optional: make sure that both lower and upper case letters are acceptable and treated as equivalent


# Check to see if the user input is in the secret word.
# If yes, notify user and ask for next letter
# If not, notify user.
# If user has not exhausted the available tries, ask for the next letter.
# If tries are exhausted, notify user that they‚Äôve lost. Reveal secret and exit.

# Make sure that your code never goes into an infinite loop, and always manages to exit gracefully (ie without throwing an error)
# Always notify the user about the correct letters/wrong letters, remaining tries.

# Additional functionality you may want to consider:
#   Provide the user with a visual clue of how they are progressing. E.g. if the secret word is ‚Äúcorrect‚Äù and the user input is ‚Äòc‚Äô, you may want to provide them with something like this:
#   C_ _ _ _ C _
# 
# You may want to give the user the option to guess the whole word when they want, instead of forcing the one-letter-at-a-time approach.

##I like the use of "-" to make a break between each section! It helps me stay focused and keep track of what you're talking about
#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#' Plan
#' Pull a random word from a text document
#' Display the number of spaces to the user
#' While loop that keep track of the user's lives and if the word has been guessed
#'        Have the user input a letter one at a time OR give them the option to 
#'        guess the whole word
#'        
#'        if the user gets the letter right
#'            Replace the corresponding underscores with the letters
#'            Check to see if the user has guessed the word
#'            
#'        else
#'            Add a body part and remove a life
#'        
#' Exit loop
#' 
#' If the user guessed the word then congratulate them
#' Else hang the man

#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# IMPORTANT NOTE FOR THE USER!!!!!:
# DOWNLOAD THE "stringi" PACKAGES IF YOU DO NOT ALREADY HAVE IT. USE THIS CODE:
# install.packages("stringi")

# load the stringi package for usage in replacing letters

# Ensure that "Hangman_Words.txt" is downloaded to the working directory

# Also, for best display when playing, maximize the console window, and do not
# look at the environment as the Secret Word will be listed
# But not for marking/code review, obviously
#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Jigsaw <- "yes" #initialize the value of Jigsaw when going into the while loop

while (Jigsaw=="yes") { #setup the while loop (1) that will circulate the user for as long as they want to play
  Jigsaw <- readline(prompt = "Would you like to play a game?\nEnter YES if so, press anything else if not.") #see if the user actually wants to play
  Jigsaw <- tolower(Jigsaw)
  if (Jigsaw=="yes"){ #if the user wants to play then...
    print("Welcome to Hangman. You have 6 lives to try and guess a word. Good luck!")
    lives <- 6 #setup how many lives they have
    SecretWordList <- read.delim("Hangman_Words.txt") #read the list of words
    GuessWord <- "‚ñØ" #preset the value of GuessWord so that it can be used in the conditional while loop
    SecretWord <- SecretWordList[sample(nrow(SecretWordList), 1), ] #randomly select a word from the secret list
    SecretWord <- tolower(SecretWord) #set the word to lowercase
    GuessWord <- paste(replicate(nchar(SecretWord), "‚ñØ"), collapse = "")# create a character that will serve as a representation of the secret word to the user, and will store their guesses
    WrongGuess <- "" #preset the wrong guess so that it can be added to in the running list of wrong guesses
    
    while (lives > 0 & SecretWord != GuessWord){ #while loop (2) that is the main game, where the user circulates until they guess the word or die
        print("") #add a space to make it easier to read the text
        print(paste("The secret word is", nchar(SecretWord), "letters long: ", GuessWord))
        if (WrongGuess != ''){ #wait until they've made a wrong guess to tell them about their wrong guesses
            print(paste("You have already guessed",WrongGuess))
        }
        print(paste("You have",lives,"lives left"))
        GuessLetter <- readline("Take a guess as to the secret word, or just guess a letter: ")
        GuessLetter <- tolower(GuessLetter) #set the guessed letter to lowercase to prevent mismatch due to the user simply holding down the shift key

##I tried testing for these conditions (ie. space, nonletter characters and I didn't receive the print statement (ie. "You didn't enter anything. Please enter a letter") 
##Why didn't it show up? I am genuinely curious why it didn't, I would love to learn more!
##On the bright side, when I enter a space/nonletter character (invalid character), it didn't take away from my lives so that is great! 
      
        if (GuessLetter == ''){ #check to see if the user just hit enter
              print("You didn't enter anything. Please enter a letter")
        } else if (!grepl("[A-Za-z]", GuessLetter)){ #make sure that the user is inputting a letter
              print("That wasn't a letter. Please enter a letter")
        } else if (nchar(GuessLetter)>1){ #if they are attempting to guess the whole word
              if (GuessLetter == SecretWord){ #did they get it right and guess the whole word

              }else{ #if they failed to guess the whole word

              }
        } else{ #if they are just trying one letter at a time
##Can you please explain what the function of gregexpr() does? I am not too familiar with this function.
##Would the unlist function unlist both the GuessLetter and SecretWord then? 
##It is really great to learn from your code! I am learning a lot! 
              LetterPosition <- unlist(gregexpr(GuessLetter, SecretWord)) #determine what the position of the letter is in SecretWord, if it is there at all
              if (LetterPosition[1]>0){ #if the letter is actually part of the word then change GuessLetter
##The stri_sub_all is a cool function from the stringi package! I will definitely save time and use this next time. 
                    stringi::stri_sub_all(GuessWord, from = LetterPosition, length = 1) <- GuessLetter #replace the blank rectangles in the GuessWord with their corresponding letter that the user just correctly guessed
              } else if(grepl(GuessLetter,WrongGuess)){ #is the user repeatedly trying the same letter?
                    print(paste("You already guessed",GuessLetter,", try a different letter"))
              } else { #otherwise you lose lives. The user is sent into this "else" if LetterPosition = -1, which is a possible value if the letter is not in SecretWord
              lives <- lives-1
              print("Wrong guess")
              WrongGuess <- paste(WrongGuess,GuessLetter) #add the wrong guess to the running list of wrong guesses
        }
        }
##What does the "\014" do in your code and what text does it display?
        cat("\014") 

##The artwork of a hangman is a really great addition to your code!
        #Artwork to be displayed depending on the lives

##Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed playing your game and learning new tricks in your code! Just because I am a beginner coder, I would love if your comments explained more about what your code does, 
##but for someone with a background in R, it is nicely commented. Great job!
